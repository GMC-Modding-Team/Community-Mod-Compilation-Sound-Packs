# Soundpacks

A soundpack can be installed in the `data/sound` directory. It has to be a subdirectory that contains at least a file named `soundpack.txt`. It can include any number of json files which add any number of sound_effect or playlist.

## soundpack.txt format

The `soundpack.txt` file format needs 2 values, a NAME and a VIEW. The NAME value should be unique. The VIEW value will be shown in the options menu. Every line starting with a `#` is a comment line.

#Basic provided soundpack
#Name of the soundpack
NAME: basic
#Viewing name of the soundpack
VIEW: Basic

(Cendar note: The game accept at least .wav and .ogg - I've read somewhere in the forums that the soundfiles must be in 44100Hz to work correctly)

## Music format

(Cendar note: Music can only be added with this format in the musicset.json file (or any other json, could be useful to make different files for different playlists, needs testing))

A playlist can be included with a format like this:

[
    {
        "type": "playlist",
        "playlists":
        [
            {
                "id" : "title",
                "shuffle" : false,
                "files" : [
                    {
                        "file": "Dark_Days_Ahead_demo_2.wav",
                        "volume": 128
                    },
                    {
                        "file": "cataclysmthemeREV6.wav",
                        "volume": 90
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]

(Cendar notes:
The only type possible is: "playlist"
You can turn shuffle on or off by changing the shuffle line to false or true)

## SFX format

(Cendar note: Sound effects can be included with a format like this in the sounset.json (or any other json, could be useful to make different files for different categories and better workflow, like ambiant.json, guns.json, etc...)

[
    {
        "type": "sound_effect",
        "id" : "menu_move",
        "volume" : 100,
        "files" : [
            "nenadsimic_menu_selection_click.wav"
        ]
    },
    {
        "type": "sound_effect",
        "id" : "fire_gun",
        "volume" : 90,
        "variant" : "bio_laser_gun",
        "files" : [
            "guns/energy_generic/weapon_fire_laser.ogg"
        ]
    }
]

Each sound effect is identified by an id and a variant. If a sound effect is played with a variant that does not exist in the json files, but a variant "default" exists, then the "default" variant is played instead. The file name of the sound effect is relative to the soundpack directory, so if the file name is set to "sfx.wav" and your soundpack is in `data/sound/mypack`, the file must be placed at `data/sound/mypack/sfx.wav`.

(Cendar note: The only type possible is: "sound_effect")

A full list of sound effect id's and variants is given in the following. Each line in the list has the following format:

`id variant1|variant2`

Where id describes the id of the sound effect, and a list of variants separated by | follows. When the variants are omitted, the variant "default" is assumed. Where the variants do not represent literal strings, but variables, they will be enclosed in `<` `>`. For instance, `<furniture>` is a placeholder for any valid furniture ID (as in the furniture definition JSON).

* `id variant1|variant2|...`
* `menu_move default`
* `menu_error default`
* `footstep default|light|clumsy|bionic`
(Cendar note: the fatigue sounds loops)
