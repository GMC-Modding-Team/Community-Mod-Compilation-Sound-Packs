CCSoundpack 0.5 - Cendar Cataclysm Soundpack 0.5

This soundpack is based on CDDA-Soundpack from @budg3

It is a work in progress. Everything is subject to changes. Like adding or removing songs, changing volumes of too loud songs, etc...

The goal is to replace all sounds to make them public domain or CC-BY.
That way, it will be easier for the dev team to have something to implement in the base game without fear of copyright infringement.
I will maybe later make two versions of this pack. One Basic with less music and one extended with a shiton load of music!

Soundpack progress:
172 new songs from different artists and sources (All can be found in the SOUNDS CREDITS.txt)
~ 425 sounds effects to change / 44 made so far

# CDDA-Soundpack

This is based on ChestHole's soundpack with some RRFSounds mixed in, but with the sounds cleaned up and some of them replaced (monster sounds, footsteps, thunder, rain, explosions etc). The music with rain embedded into them were replaced with new songs as well. This should fix the "it's raining while it's not raining bug". Covered the weapon sounds for all ranged weapons in vanilla experimental (as of May 2018). Finally this adds sound effects to the bionics that were missing and A LOT of missing smash sounds for terrain and furniture. This soundpack covers all available sounds supported by soundpacks (as of May 2018).

# Supported Mods that add ranged weapons
- Artyoms' Gun Emporium
- Bionics Systems Mod
- Vehicle Additions Pack
- Tanks and Other Vehicles
- Icecoon's Arsenal
- DeadLeaves' Fictional Guns
- Modern Weapon Pack Expanded

Mods that add new melee weapons should work automatically.

# Music from
- ??? (I don't know where the ones included with the original soundpack are from - my guess is Fallout and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.)
- Cubus
- Ashes of Apocalypse (dead postapoc Morrowind TC mod)
- Ground Zero (dead postapoc Doom 3 TC mod)
- Fallout
- Fallout Van Buren
- Ghost in the Shell (anime)
- 1984
- Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines
- Dead Rising
- 28 Days Later

All the music has been carefully selected to match the overall ambient tone, with some of them being slightly different for variety, while not straying too far. Some of the music has been edited to remove parts that stood out too much. Most of the music will sound pretty bad on laptop speakers etc, so wear headphones or use proper speakers.

If you want to replace the music and use your own, you can replace the bg .ogg files. If you want to disable the music, then delete the musicset.json file and all the bg .ogg files in the music folder.
